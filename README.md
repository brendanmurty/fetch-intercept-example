# Fetch intercept example

An example of intercepting a Fetch request using vanilla JavaScript.

Requirements:

1. A local version of my [Pinboard React Client](https://github.com/brendanmurty/pinboard-react-client) is running locally on port `8888`
2. That system has the line `PINBOARD_APP_ALLOW_ALL_CORS_REQUESTS=true` added to `.env`
